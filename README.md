function
========
This app contains several functions. 
- computing the area of a room
- checking for legal drinking age
- changing a number grade to a letter grade
- adding tax to an amount
- getting the sum of an array
- getting the factorial of a number
- getting odds of rolling dice

It's a little clunky and has a lot of notes scattered throughout for my later reference.
